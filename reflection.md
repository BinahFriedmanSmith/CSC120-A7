- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

frankly the gotofloor override instruction confused me. It seems like it wants you to make moving between any two floors possible for some buldings, and the phrasing implies you are adding functionality. However, goToFloor is a publically avaliable method from all buildings already? So i just did some stuff and now the flavor seems right. i think elevator shouldnt be broken up between sublclasses since a houses elevator isnt meaningfully different from a library's. I probably should have come to office hours to ask about this but I am a chronic procrastinator and that is not an option anymore. when will i learn.
I decided to overload the constructors for the children, since i thought it would be helpful to not have to specify some things. then iwas looking for other thins to overload and noticed that sellCoffee has three variables, and three is too many so you can now order a plain black coffee with no inputs at all. the others didnt really have anthing that seemed like it could benefit from defaults other than the constructors...

I PUT IT OFF UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE AGAIN WHY DO I DO THIS TO MYSELF
IM BLAMING STRESS FROM THE ELECTION //BUT I KNOW I AM THE REAL PROBLEM//

extra hot tip there are two ds in address. i keep forgetting this for some reason and i have to go back and correct it two seconds later 90% of the time
